# weather
You must have node installed on your machine
The application is starting with "node index.js"
After this you have to run localhost:3000/forecast for HTTP or https://localhost:4000/forecast for HTTPS with lat, lon and API KEY as query parameters
The API KEY provided in the project description is not working so I created one
The output is the averages for 5 days in Celsius and an aray of 5 days data
In case of wrong data the application will show the error thrown by the API
